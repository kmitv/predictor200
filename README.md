## About Predictor 2000
Great part about using web APIs is the ability to incorporate modern scientific computing tools into always- accessible web apps. This is the case with Predictor 2000. I demonstrate the use of popular Python tools with SPA framework (Angular) and treat it as a starting point for more complex solutions.
## Features:
* Add and delete entries
* Preview added entries in a table
* Create multiple linear regression models
* Visualize created model (along with the data used to create it) on a graph
* Use created models to predict values

The idea behind this app is to serve as a complete field test for a web app which is able to utilize machine learning algorithm to create an easy and intuitive way to use AI via a web browser. Note: it is best experienced with the latest version of Chrome on at least 1080p wide screen (for now).

## Tools used on the back-end side:
* Django
* scikit-learn
* NumPy
* MatPlotLib
* SQLite
